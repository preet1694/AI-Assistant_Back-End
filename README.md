# 🚀 Project Setup & Run Instructions

This README explains how to set up and run the entire project from scratch.

---

## ✅ 1. Create a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

### **Windows**
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

### **macOS / Linux**
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

---

## ✅ 2. Install Required Packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, install all dependencies using:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install everything listed in **requirements.txt**.

---

## ✅ 3. Running the Project

This project uses **two Python scripts** that must run **in parallel**.

Open **two separate terminal tabs**.

---

### **🟦 Terminal Tab 1 – Run `main.py`**

    python main.py

---

### **🟩 Terminal Tab 2 – Run `SpeechToSpeech.py`**

    python SpeechToSpeech.py

---

## 🔄 4. Keep Both Scripts Running

Both terminals must remain open.  
If any one stops, the system will not work correctly.

---

## 🎉 All Set!

Your project is now running successfully.  
Keep both terminals active and enjoy using the application.
